This script will obtain fileless persistence on a Windows 7+ machine under both Standard and Administrative accounts by 
using two Alternate Data Streams. The first Alternate Data stream stores the payloadand the second Alternate Data Stream 
stores some VBScript that acts as a wrapper in order to hide the DOS prompt when invoking the data stream containing the 
payload. When passing the arguments, you have to include the function and any parameters required by your payload. 
The arguments must also be in quotation marks.
